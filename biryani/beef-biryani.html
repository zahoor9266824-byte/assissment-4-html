    <h3>recipe of beef biryani</h3>
    To make beef biryani, marinate 500g beef pieces in 1/2 cup yogurt, 1 tsp ginger paste, 1 tsp garlic paste, 1 tsp cumin powder, 1 tsp coriander powder, 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1/2 tsp red chili powder, and salt to taste for at least 30 minutes. Cook 2 cups basmati rice until 70% done, then drain and set aside. In a large pot, heat 2 tbsp oil and sauté 1 large onion until golden brown. Add the marinated beef and cook until it's tender. Layer the cooked rice over the beef, adding 1/4 cup chopped mint, 1/4 cup chopped coriander, and 2 tbsp fried onions. Pour 1/4 cup milk with a pinch of saffron dissolved in it over the rice. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for 15-20 minutes. Serve hot and enjoy!
