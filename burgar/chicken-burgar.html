        recipe of chicken-burgar
    </h3>
    To make a chicken burger, combine 500g chicken mince, 1 finely chopped onion, 2-3 finely chopped garlic cloves, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, and 1/4 tsp red chili powder in a bowl. Mix well and divide the mixture into 4-6 equal portions. Shape each portion into a round patty and cook in a pan with 1 tbsp oil on medium heat for 4-5 minutes on each side. Lightly toast burger buns on a griddle, then place cooked patty, lettuce leaves, tomato, onion, and your favorite toppings in the bun. You can also add some mayo or mustard to give it an extra kick. Serve hot and enjoy!
